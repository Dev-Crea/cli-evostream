ListConfig      Returns a list with all push/pull configurations.
                Whenever the pullStream or pushStream interfaces are called, a record
                containing the details of the pull or push is created in the
                pullpushconfig.xml file. Then, the next time the EMS is started, the
                pullpushconfig.xml file is read, and the EMS attempts to reconnect all
                of the previous pulled or pushed streams.

ListStreams     Provides a detailed description of all active streams.
